Mission of the committee
------------------------
The mission of the Django Software Foundation well-being committee is
to provide peer support for community members who need to talk to someone who understands.

Background
----------
Following the success of the counseling sessions at DjangoCon Europe 2015,
we saw that community members can get a lot of value from the opportunity
to share and discuss personal issues that they encounter during their work
on open-source projects.

Providing counselors like DjangoCon did is often very difficult. However,
much can be gained, both in our personal experience and experiences shared
by many others, with support from peers. It can already be a great relief
and feel very validating to talk to other people that have experienced
some of the same struggles, particularly those familiar with our profession
and involvement in open-source communities. The idea of setting up some type
of peer-support network surfaced and caught on fairly quickly.

After some deliberation, we realized that it might be beneficial to the
community if this initiative was incorporated into the DSF, so that community
members would feel comfortable and supported by their community.

Goals
-----
Lacking the resources to set up a professional counseling network, we believe
that the peer-support model (similar to those applied in
"big brother/sister"-style mentorship programs, as well as some recovery
communities such as Alcoholics Anonymous) will help community members get past
the initial hurdle of "just talking to someone who understands", and provide a
baseline communication channel through which the person in need can express
their thoughts and feelings in a safe environment. This can already provide
relief and validation, and if needed, makes the step towards professional
care easier.

Notably, this would not be a replacement for professional help, and care must
be taken to guard the well-being of the committee members themselves.

Values
------

A few core values are at the base of the committee, and define how the
committee will run:

* Guarding the well-being of the committee members themselves is
  essential, and this must be placed above all other goals.
* As they are not professionals, committee members have to be supported
  in their tasks, in first instance by the other members.
* Community members will be sharing very private information with the
  committee, and their privacy is therefore very important. However, in
  some or all cases, it can be important to share information with other
  committee members. This requires are careful process.
* A committee member, or the committee as a whole, is always free to
  be no longer willing to support a community member.
* If a community member shows behaviour towards a committee member that
  violates the code of conduct, they should be free to share this with
  the code of conduct committee and anyone involved in possible legal action.
* Due to its sensitivity and importance, a process should be in place for
  situations where a community member is a danger to themselves or others.
